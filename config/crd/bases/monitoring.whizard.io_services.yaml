                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  other valid resources associated with PVC. \n This

                                  be in any of following states: - ControllerResizeInProgress:
                                  State set when resize controller starts resizing
                                  the volume in control-plane. - ControllerResizeFailed:
                                  State set when resize has failed in resize controller
                                  with a terminal error. - NodeResizePending: State
                                  set when resize controller has finished resizing
                                  the volume but further resizing of volume is needed
                                  on the node. - NodeResizeInProgress: State set when
                                  kubelet starts resizing the volume. - NodeResizeFailed:
                                  State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with
                                  a terminal error. Transient errors don't set NodeResizeFailed.
                                  For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity
                                  - this field can be one of the following states:
                                  - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']
                                  = \"ControllerResizeInProgress\" - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']
                                  = \"ControllerResizeFailed\" - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']
                                  = \"NodeResizePending\" - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']
                                  = \"NodeResizeInProgress\" - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage']
                                  = \"NodeResizeFailed\" When this field is not set,
                                  it means that no resize operation is in progress
                                  for the given PVC. \n A controller that receives
                                  PVC update with previously unknown resourceName
                                  or ClaimResourceStatus should ignore the update
                                  for the purpose it was designed. For example - a
                                  controller that only is responsible for resizing
                                  capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates
                                  that change other valid resources associated with

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a

                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)

                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                            be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
